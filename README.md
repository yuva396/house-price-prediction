# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The model takes various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors to estimate the house price accurately.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

    To clone the repository, run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the project files by clicking on the **Download ZIP** button on GitHub.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    If you are using a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies in one go by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the individual dependencies using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
    ```

    This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser, and you can start working with the code.
